# We can see that the fit is getting more smoother when we increase the value of omega.
# In locally weighted regression, the hyperparameter omega controls how much of the 
# surrounding data influences the fit at any given point. Larger omega increases the size of 
# the window around the target point z, meaning more data points will contribute to 
# the local regression fit for each point, thus effectively averaging out local fluctuations 
# and reducing the impact of noise, leading to smoother curves.
